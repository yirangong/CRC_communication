# CRC_communication

We investigate the **cognitive dynamics of collaborative planning**, focusing on when and why **verbal communication** is initiated and how it interacts with the **structure of the decision space**. Specifically, we ask:

- **When** do players choose to speak?
- **What** patterns emerge in speech use across different task states?
- **How** does communication affect **planning performance and bias**?

## Data Pool

- `basic_map_1`: Raw map data (coordinates, metadata).
- `basic_summary_1`: Precomputed metrics and gameplay stats for maps.

## Game Map Analysis
- Utilizes map information using the data pool.
- More information in the folder README file

## `map_blocks.xlsx`
- Exported map sets for testing or training.
